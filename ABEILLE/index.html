    <p>
Bees perform different tasks throughout their lives. Thus, in the hive we find :
  </p>


    <p>
      The cleaner: she makes sure that everything is clean, that no dangerous fungus develops and plays a fundamental role in the fight against parasites, especially Varroa.
      The nurse: her mission is to feed the larvae and the queen. It is she who produces royal jelly thanks to special organs.
      The mason : she builds the cells on the frames that the beekeeper will have prepared for her.
      The handler: she transports everything that needs to be transported (corpses, waste...).  </p>


  <p>
    The ventilator: placed at the entrance of the hive, the beating of its wings ensures ventilation and an optimal temperature for the development of the larvae.
    The guardian: it defends the hive against its enemies. We can remind you that bee venom is particularly effective and that you should never approach within 5 meters of an unprotected hive.
    The forager: it is the one we see the most, this period of life of heavy labor is short, it collects the inputs necessary for the operation of the hive and can move more than 3 kilometers away from the hive.   </div>

  <p>A hive is a structure housing a colony of bees. The inside of the hive is composed of combs formed by hexagonal cells of beeswax. The bees use these cells to store honey and pollen.
The hive is the unit of life built by the beekeeper to house a colony of one of the two domesticated bee species. It is a wooden box.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>

  <div class="la-vie-ruche"  id="step-2-first">
  <img src="images/honey.jpg" alt="">
  <div class="text-content-step2">
  <p>The role of bees is of crucial importance. In addition to producing honey in the apiaries, they are actively involved in pollination between the different flower species. This is why we are going to take a little more interest in this phenomenon in our gardens.</p>

<p>The bee is endowed with a trichromatic vision that allows it to perceive the colors and the path to follow to locate, in the heart of the flower, the places richest in nectar. It is very sensitive to the perfume given off by the flower, to ultraviolet rays and to bright colors such as blue and yellow.</p>

<p>The bee is known to be the best pollinator and for good reason. The bee alone is capable of collecting pollen from 250 flowers per hour, and of storing 500,000 grains of pollen on a single leg. Whether wild or domesticated, of the 100 species of plants that are part of our food resources, the bee alone pollinates 71 of them.</p>

<p>
  Observed since the 1990s, the decline of bees is a growing concern. Each winter, it is sometimes up to 35% of the colonies that disappear. This hecatomb certainly finds multiple origins, but the main causes are human.  </p>
